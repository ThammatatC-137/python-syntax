Taewondo Tornado Kick is one of the most exciting move
to watch in martial arts. It takes 360-degree body rotation
and hip thrust to deliver a very powerful kick.
Write a program to calculate force at impact:
ask a user for impact duration t (s),
an effective kicking leg weight m (kg),
an effective kicking leg length r (m),
kick execution time T (s) for full 360 rotation,
calculate impact velocity v (in km/h and mph)
and impact force f (in N and lb f)
and report the calculations.
Note: (1) impact force can be estimated from f = m * v / t;
(2) impact velocity can be estimated from v = omega * r,
where is an angular velocity (rad/s);
(3) kick execution time T = (2 pi)/omega;
(4) 1 mph = 1.61 km/h and 1 lb f = 4.45 N.
